# Spectrum
This was a project I created for my Trigonometry with Algebra class. The specific assignment was to solve a set of trigonometric sine equations and find a new and interesting way to present the graphs. Each different graph was a frequency of light, so the entirety of the project showed the frequencies of light. This GitHub repository contains the files that made up the webpage I presented in class, but if you want to see it in action, head over to https://ksamuel890.github.io/Spectrum/.

And yes, the teacher and the entire class were wowed by the presentation. :)
